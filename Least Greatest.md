## GCD & LCM

we know the relation between GCD and LCM is : 
```python
LCM (a,b) × GCD(a,b) = |a×b|
```
But this is not ideal in this kind of question, Because it takes a lot complexity. 
Therefore, the best way is usgin the prime factorization !! 

### Prime Factorization
 
```python
find GCD(6,21) and LCM(6,21)
```
