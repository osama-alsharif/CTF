## GCD & LCM

we know the relation between GCD and LCM is : 
```python
GCD(a,b) × LCM (a,b) = |a×b|
```
But this is not ideal in this kind of question, Because it takes a lot complexity. 
Therefore, the best way is usgin the prime factorization !! 

### Prime Factorization
 
```python
find GCD(6,21) and LCM(6,21) ? 

primeFactors of 6 : 2 × 3 
primeFactors of 21 : 3 × 7 
```
![](/PF1)


```python
so the 'common factors' is only {3} ==> GCD 
and the unique factors are {2, 3, 7} ==> LCM

So GCD = 3, LCM = 42
```
